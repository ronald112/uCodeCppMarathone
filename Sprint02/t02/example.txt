Lifts-Her-Tail
Certainly not, kind sir! I'm here but to clean your chambers.

Crantius Colto
Is that all you have come here for, little one? My chambers?

Lifts-Her-Tail

I am but a poor Argonian maid.
Crantius Colto
So you are, my dumpling. And a good one at that.
Such strong legs and shapely tail.
