The Wabbajack is the Daedric artifact of Sheogorath, a mysterious staff that casts random spells
ranging in effect from the complete disintegration, to the transformation, or empowerment of
the target.
These abilities are able to completely alter the course of battle in one of any number of ways.

The Wabbajack is one of 5 Daedric artifacts made by the Daedric Prince of Madness, Sheogorath.
Its rogue nature is a reflection upon Sheogorath's own chaos, choosing at random to either help
or hinder those he encounters.
